The objective is to recognize handwritten digits with neural network implemented in MATLAB. The initial precision and recall rate is both 0.95.
4000 sample images are used to training the system, with 20*20 (400 features) pixels in each image
The NN is implemented in three levels, with 400 nodes for the input level, 25 nodes in the hidden layer and 10 nodes in the output level.
